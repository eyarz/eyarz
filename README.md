n August 10, 2023, HashiCorp announced a change of license for its products, including Terraform. After ~9 years of Terraform being open source under the MPL v2 license, it was to move under a non-open source BSL v1.1 license, starting from the next (1.6) version.

It is our belief that under the business license, the future of Terraform looks bleak. Community focus will shift, businesses will start looking for OSS alternatives, and independent tooling will gradually disappear. 

Simply put, the license is a poison pill for the Terraform ecosystem. One that will also have a ripple effect on other open-source projects, and undermine the credibility of open-source as a concept.

With this in mind, we are proud to be one of the first companies to join together in OpenTF, an initiative to keep Terraform open sourceâ€“forever.
